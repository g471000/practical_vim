Pratice with below example:

Line One
Line Two 
Line Three
Line Four 

x command deletes the character under the cursor.
dot(.) command repeat last change.
.. comand repeat twice last change.
after performing those three tasks, it will become...

 One
Line Two 
Line Three
Line Four 

dd comannd also performs a deletion, but a whole line.
dot(.) will delete another line
dot-dot(..) will delete 2 lines
from the previous output, if after performing those three tasks,,,

(deleted all lines)

Let's come back to the original example: 

Line One
Line Two 
Line Three
Line Four 

>G command increses the indentation from the current line until the end.
let's try...
>G
j
.
..

Line One
	Line Two 
		Line Three
				Line Four
